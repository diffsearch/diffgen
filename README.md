## ANN Baseline Model to Predict Differential Validity
  This file uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the validity of differentials in GFS block ciphers using a deep learning model trained on features such as truncated differences, number of rounds, and permutation patterns.
## ANN Generalization Model to Predict TWINE Round 15 Differential Validity
  This file uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the validity of differentials in GFS block ciphers (TWINE) using a deep learning model trained on features such as truncated differences, number of rounds, and permutation patterns. 
## ANN Generalization Model to Predict Perm5 Round 15 Differential Validity
  This file uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the validity of differentials in GFS block ciphers (Perm5) using a deep learning model trained on features such as truncated differences, number of rounds, and permutation patterns.  
## Neural Network Model and GA to Predict TWINE Round 15
  This file uses a neural network and a genetic algorithm to predict the differentials of TWINE Round 15. The proposed differential validity prediction model was used alongside an active S-box prediction model to find differentials through prediction. The genetic algorithm was used to identify suitable starting points for the search.
